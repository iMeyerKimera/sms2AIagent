- üåê **[Ngrok Setup](NGROK_SETUP.md)** - How to configure permanent domains
- üöÄ **[Production Setup](PRODUCTION_SETUP.md)** - Complete production deployment guide

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Twilio account (for SMS functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for AI integration)
- Ngrok account (for webhook exposure and permanent domains)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sms2AIagent
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your credentials:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your actual credentials:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# Cursor AI Configuration
CURSOR_API_KEY=your_cursor_api_key_here
CURSOR_WORKSPACE_ID=your_cursor_workspace_id_here

# OpenAI Configuration (for Cursor AI integration)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Ngrok Configuration
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_ngrok_auth_token_here

# Voice Assistant Configuration (optional)
ENABLE_VOICE_ASSISTANT=True
VOICE_LANGUAGE=en-US
VOICE_RATE=150
```

### 3. Start the System

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 4. Configure Twilio Webhook

1. Go to your Twilio Console
2. Navigate to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active numbers
3. Click on your phone number
4. Set the webhook URL for incoming messages to:
   ```
   https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/sms
   ```
   Get your your-ngrok-url here after you stand up the system's container
   ```
   http://0.0.0.0:4040/inspect/http
   ```
5. Set the HTTP method to POST
6. Locally test the system's health and functionality
   ```
   docker-compose exec web python test_setup.py
   ```

### 5. Test the SMS System

Send an SMS to your Twilio phone number with a task like:
- "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"
- "Create a React component for a todo list"
- "Explain how Docker containers work"
- "Debug this JavaScript code: [paste code]"

## How It Works

1. **Receive SMS**: Twilio receives your SMS and forwards it to the Flask webhook
2. **Task Analysis**: The system analyzes if your request is a coding task
3. **Cursor AI Processing**: Coding tasks are handled by Cursor AI, general tasks by OpenAI
4. **Voice Response**: If enabled, creates voice-friendly audio responses
5. **Summarization**: The AI response is automatically summarized to fit SMS character limits
6. **Response**: The summarized result is sent back to your phone via SMS

## Voice Assistant Integration

### Siri/Alexa Compatibility

The system includes voice assistant capabilities for integration with Siri and Alexa:

#### Text-to-Speech Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/voice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "text_to_speech",
    "text": "Your response text here"
  }'
```

#### Speech-to-Text Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/voice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "speech_to_text",
    "audio_file": "path/to/audio.wav"
  }'
```

#### Monitor Local Ngrok requests
You can monitor your sms post requests here:
```
http://0.0.0.0:4040/inspect/http
```

#### Audio File Access
Generated audio files are available at:
```
http://localhost:5001/audio/filename.mp3
```

### Voice Assistant Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI responses to speech
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts voice input to text
- **Voice Optimization**: Automatically optimizes technical content for voice output
- **Multi-language Support**: Configurable language settings
- **Siri/Alexa Integration**: Compatible with voice assistant platforms

## API Endpoints

- `POST /sms`: Main webhook endpoint for receiving SMS messages from Twilio
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /voice`: Voice assistant endpoint for Siri/Alexa integration
- `GET /audio/<filename>`: Serve generated audio files
- `GET /cursor/workspace`: Get Cursor workspace information

## Configuration Options

### Voice Assistant Settings

You can customize voice behavior in your `.env` file:

```env
ENABLE_VOICE_ASSISTANT=True
VOICE_LANGUAGE=en-US
VOICE_RATE=150
```

### SMS Length Limits

The system automatically summarizes responses to fit SMS limits:

```env
MAX_SMS_LENGTH=160
```

## Development

### Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_setup.py
```

This will test:
- Environment variables
- Cursor AI integration
- Voice assistant functionality
- Twilio API connection
- Flask application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cursor AI agent not initialized"**: Check your CURSOR_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
2. **"Voice assistant not enabled"**: Set ENABLE_VOICE_ASSISTANT=True in your .env file
3. **"Twilio webhook not receiving messages"**: Ensure the webhook URL is correctly configured
4. **"Audio files not accessible"**: Check file permissions and ensure the audio directory exists

### Logs

Check the Docker logs for detailed error information:

```bash
docker-compose logs web
docker-compose logs ngrok
```

## Security and Future Considerations

- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` for security
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- Review and adjust voice assistant settings based on your use case
- Consider further enhancements (e.g., error handling, logging, advanced task routing, admin dashboard, analytics, etc.)
